A Wireless Access Point (WAP) is a networking device that allows connecting the devices with 
the wired network. A Wireless Access Point (WAP) is used to create the WLAN (Wireless Local 
Area Network), it is commonly used in large offices and buildings which have expanded 
businesses. 
A wireless AP connects the wired networks to the wireless client. It eases access to the network 
for mobile users which increases productivity and reduces the infrastructure cost. 
Advantages of Wireless Access Point (WAP): 
1) More User Access 
2) Broader Transmission Range 
3) Flexible Networking 
Disadvantages of Wireless Access Point (WAP): 
1) High cost 
2) Poor stability 
3) Less Secure 
Application of Wireless Access Point: 
1) It is a device that creates a WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) in large enterprises.  
2) It is used to extend the coverage area of the network so that it canâ€™t disconnect which 
allows more users to connect to the network easily. 
3) An access point connects a switch, Ethernet cable, wired router, and Wi-fi to designate 
the particular area. 
4) It is used to provide connectivity to the users in large offices or enterprises which allows 
users to roam easily anywhere in the office and be connected to a network.
