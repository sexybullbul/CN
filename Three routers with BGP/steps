Theory: 
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used to Exchange routing information for the 
internet and is the protocol used between ISP which are different Autonoumous 
Systems (AS).  
The protocol can connect together any internetwork of autonomous system using 
an arbitrary topology. The only requirement is that each AS have at least one router 
that is able to run BGP and that is router connect to at least one other AS’s BGP 
router.  
BGP’s main function is to exchange network reach-ability information with other 
BGP systems.  
Characteristics of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): 
a) The main role of BGP is to provide communication between two 
autonomous systems. 
b) BGP supports Next-Hop Paradigm. 
c) Coordination among multiple BGP speakers within the AS (Autonomous 
System). 
d) BGP advertisement also include path information, along with the reachable 
destination and next destination pair. 
e) BGP can implement policies that can be configured by the administrator.  
f) BGP runs Over TCP. 
g) BGP conserve network Bandwidth. 
h) BGP supports CIDR. 
i) BGP also supports Security
